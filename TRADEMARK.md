# Hensu™ Trademark Policy

This document describes the trademark policy for the **Hensu** project. While our source code is available under the
**Apache License, Version 2.0**, that license does not grant you any rights to use our trademarks.

This policy is designed to protect the integrity of the Hensu engine and ensure that users can trust the source of the
software they are running.

## 1. Ownership

The **Hensu™** name, the axolotl logo, and any related brand identifiers (the "Trademarks") are trademarks owned by 
**Aleksandr Suvorov** ("Project Owner").

## 2. Permitted Use

You may use the Hensu word mark without prior written permission for the following purposes:

* **Factual Statements:** To truthfully state that your software is "built on," "compatible with," or "derived from" the
  Hensu engine.
* **Community Discussion:** To refer to the project in blog posts, social media, academic papers, tutorials,
  presentations, or videos.
* **Unmodified Distribution:** To identify the software in its original, unmodified form as provided in this repository.
* **Powered By Branding:** You are encouraged to use "Built with Hensu™" or "Powered by Hensu™" badges in your project
  documentation or on your website to acknowledge the underlying engine.

## 3. Restricted Use (Requires Permission)

You may **not** use the Hensu name or logo in a way that suggests an official affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship
by the Project Owner. Specifically:

* **Commercial Products:** You cannot name your commercial product "Hensu Enterprise," "Hensu Cloud," or similar without
  written consent.
* **Forks:** If you fork the project, you must rename the repository to something distinct. Publicly distributed forks
  may not use "Hensu" as the primary brand or at the beginning of the repository name (e.g., `my-engine-based-on-hensu`
  is acceptable; `hensu-pro` or `hensu-next` is not).
* **Domain Names:** You may not register domain names that include the word "Hensu" (e.g., `hensu-cloud.com`) without
  permission.
* **Implying Endorsement:** You may not use the trademark in a way that implies your product or service is officially
  produced or managed by the Hensu project.

## 4. Logo and Brand Assets

The Hensu axolotl logo is a trademark of the Project Owner. Community and editorial use of the logo is permitted and
encouraged—including in blog posts, social media, conference talks, and reviews.

The logo must be used in its original, unmodified form without alteration, recoloring, stretching, or combination with
other branding elements. Use of the logo on commercial products, merchandise, or paid services requires prior written
permission.

## 5. Trademark Symbols

When mentioning the brand for the first time in a document or on a webpage, please use the trademark symbol: **Hensu™**.
